        Love Kuching Project is a cat rescue group that started in 2009 from our founderâ€™s own residence! Today, we
        have our own shelter space and continue to be entirely volunteer-run. We specialise in palliative care for
        older cats, medical care for chronically ill or injured cats, as well as neonatal care for young kittens.
